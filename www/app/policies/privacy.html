    <p>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to
        certain information about you.</p>
    <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details
        (like your Facebook, X, Google, YouTube logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on
        the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile
        picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
    <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that
        are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
        responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend
        that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information,
        and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

    <!-- 6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?   -->
    <h3 id="C6">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

        privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
        other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
        longer than 24 hours past the start of the idle period of the user's account.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    <p>We don't keep information about your YouTube activity.</p>

    <!--  7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?  -->
    <h3 id="C7">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
    <p><b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
        security measures.</p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
        the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
        be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
        environment.</p>
